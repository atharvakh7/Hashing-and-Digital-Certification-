Hashing and Digital Certification

Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **cryptographic hashing** and **digital certification** to ensure data integrity, authenticity, and security.  
It covers generating secure hashes, creating digital signatures, and verifying digital certificates.

Features
- Generate secure hash values (SHA, MD5, etc.)
- Verify integrity of files/messages using hashing
- Create and verify digital certificates
- Implement digital signatures for authentication
- Simple CLI-based interface

Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- `hashlib` for hashing
- `cryptography` library for certificates and signatures
